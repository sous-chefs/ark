  "long_description": "Overview        \n========\n\nAn '''ark''' is like an archive but '''Kewler''\n\nDoes the fetch-unpack-configure-build-install dance. This is a\nmodified  verion of Infochimps awesome install_from cookbook\n [http://github.com/infochimps-cookbooks/install_from](install_dir \"/usr/local/share/tomcat/lib\")\n\nGiven a project `pig`, with url `http://apache.org/pig/pig-0.8.0.tar.gz`, and\nthe default :prefix_root of `/usr/local`, this provider will\n\n* fetch  it to to `/usr/local/src`\n* unpack it to :install_dir  (`/usr/local/share/pig-0.8.0`)\n* create a symlink for :home_dir (`/usr/local/share/pig`) pointing to :install_dir\n* configure the project\n* build the project\n* install the project\n\nBy default, the ark will not run again if the :install_dir is not\nempty. You can specify a more granular condition by using :stop_file\nwhose existence in :install_dir indicates that the ark has already\nbeen unpacked. This is useful when you use several arks to deposit\nlibraries in a common directory like /usr/local/lib/ or /usr/local/share/tomcat/lib\n\nAt this time ark only handles files available from URLs. It does not\nhandle local files.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nYou can customize the basic attributes to meet your organization's conventions\n\n* default[:ark][:apache_mirror] = 'http://apache.mirrors.tds.net'\n* default[:ark][:prefix_root] = \"/usr/local\"\n* default[:ark][:prefix_home] = \"share\"\n* default[:ark][:prefix_install] = \"share\"\n* default[:ark][:prefix_src] = \"src\"\n\n\nResources/Providers\n===================\n\n# Actions\n\n- :install: extracts the file and makes a symlink of requested\n- :remove: removes the extracted directory and related symlink #TODO\n\n# Attribute Parameters\n\n- release_url: url for tarball, .tar.gz, .bin (oracle-specific), .war, and .zip\n  currently supported. Also supports special syntax\n  :name:version:apache_mirror: that will auto-magically construct\n  download url from the apache mirrors site\n- version: software version, required\n- checksum: sha256 checksum, used for security \n- prefix_root: prefix_root for installation, defaults to /usr/local/\n- mode: file mode for app_home, is an integer\n- has_binaries: array of binary commands to symlink to /usr/local/bin/\n- add_global_bin_dir: boolean, similar to has_binaries but less granular\n  - If true, append the ./bin directory of the extracted directory to\n  the PATH environment  variable for all users, does this by placing a file in /etc/profile.d/ which will be read by all users\n  be added to the path. The commands are symbolically linked to\n  /usr/bin/* . Examples are mvn, java, javac, etc. This option\n  provides more granularity than the boolean option\n- user: owner of extracted directory, set to \"root\" by default\n- strip_leading_dir: by default, strip the leading directory from the\n  extracted archive this can cause unexpected results if there is more\n  than one subdirectory in the archive\n- junk_paths: The archive's  directory structure is not recreated; all files are\n  deposited in the extraction directory. Only applies to zip archives\n- stop_file: if you are appending files to a given directory, ark\n  needs a condition to test whether the file has already been\n  extracted. You can specify a stop_file, a file whose existence\n  indicates the ark has previously been extracted and does not need to\n  be extracted again\n\n# Examples\n\n    # install Apache Ivy dependency resolution tool\n    ark \"ivy\" do\n        release_url 'http://someurl.example.com/ivy.tar.gz'\n        version '2.2.0'        \n    end\n    \nThis example copies ivy.tar.gz to /usr/local/src/ivy-2.2.0.tar.gz,\nunpacks its contents to /usr/local/share/ivy-2.2.0/ -- stripping the\nleading directory, and symlinks /usr/local/share/ivy to /usr/local/shary/ivy-2.2.0\n\n\n     ark 'jdk' do\n       release_url 'http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u2-b13/jdk-7u2-linux-x64.tar.gz'\n       version '7.2'\n       home_dir \"/usr/local/jvm/default\" \n       add_global_bin_dir true\n       user 'foobar'\n     end\n\nThis example copies jdk-7u2-linux-x64.tar.gz to /usr/local/src/jdk-7.2.tar.gz,\nunpacks its contents to /usr/local/share/jdk-7.2/ -- stripping the\nleading directory, symlinks /usr/local/jvm/default to\n/usr/local/share/jkd-7.2, and adds /usr/local/share/jdk-7.2/bin/ to\nthe global PATH for all users. The user 'foobar' is the owner of the\n/usr/local/share/jdk-7.2 directory\n\n     ark 'liferay-client' do\n       release_url \"http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/lportal/Liferay%20Portal/6.1.0%20GA1/liferay-portal-client-6.1.0-ce-ga1-20120106155615760.zip?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Flportal%2Ffiles%2FLiferay%2520Portal%2F6.1.0%2520GA1%2F&ts=1329490764&use_mirror=ignum\"\n       version \"6.1.0\"\n       install_dir \"/usr/local/share/tomcat/lib\"\n       home_dir \"/usr/local/share/tomcat/lib\"\n       user \"hitman\"\n       stop_file \"portal-client.jar\"\n     end\n\n\n\n## License and Author\n\nAuthor::                Philip (flip) Kromer - Infochimps, Inc (<coders@infochimps.com>)\nAuthor::                Bryan W.
